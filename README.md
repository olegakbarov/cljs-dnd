Idiomatic drag-and-drop for ClojureScript applications with React rendering

# ==============================
# WORK IN PROGRESS / NOT USEABLE
# ==============================

# Goals

- Declarative drag-and-drop for ClojureScript apps rendered with React
- Not dependent on framework (Reagent/Rum)
- Flexible and low-level solution
- Use of ClojureScript killer features: `core.async` & `Google Closure`
- pluggable backends (html5, touch)
